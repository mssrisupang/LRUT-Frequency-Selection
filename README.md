# LRUT Frequency Selection

This project is a Tkinter-based Python application that allows users to analyze and visualize DWG images and perform Pearson Correlation between frequencies. The user can set the path to their data, and the application will display confusion matrices, overlay plots, and DWG images.

## Features

- **Pearson Correlation Analysis**: Calculate Pearson correlation between different frequencies.
- **DWG Image Overlay**: Overlay DWG images for visual comparison.
- **Confusion Matrix Plot**: Display confusion matrices of frequency correlations.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A Tkinter-based GUI for ease of use.
